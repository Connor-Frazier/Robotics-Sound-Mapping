Quesitons for Robotics Final Project

This file should be filled in once for your team and submited once each to the three project assignments: Code, Demo, Presentation

Make sure to answer all the questions here to qualify for full project credit.


1. What are the names of all members of your team?

Nolan Bock, Connor Frazier Matthew Pashkowsky, Andrew Wirth


2. In no more than three sentences, what was your project?

This project explored having a line follower robot autonomously find its way through a simple line based world to a sound emitting target. This included creating a robot firmware, serial communication protocol, gazebo simulation of the world and robot, and control program. For the control program we implemented two algorithms from academic papers; “Algorithm for Line Follower Robots to Follow Critical Paths with Minimum Number of Sensors” and “Auditory Occupancy Grids with a Mobile Robot”.


3. What did each team member do to contribute to the project?

Nolan Bock: The gazebo simulation including the world, sensor plugins, and other simulation details.

Connor Frazier: The arduino firmware, mBot Ranger Command Library, and rg_robot/gz_robot classes implementation and build.

Matthew Pashkowsky: The line following algorithm.

Andrew Wirth: The sound occupancy grid mapping algorithm.



4. What is the URL of your git repository with all your project code and your
presentation notes / slides?

URL: https://github.com/nbock/cs5335-nm


5. Which component do you think was the most innately difficult to build?


6. What's the URL to your Demo video?


7. What's the URL to your Presentation video?


8. Did you share any generally useful example code with other teams to try for
a bonus point? If so, what's the Git repo and Piazza post URLs?
