# ðŸ¤– Microphone Plugin for mBot Ranger.
## Description
The [mBot ranger](https://www.makeblock.com/steam-kits/mbot-ranger) has a built in microphone that measures sound from the environment. This plugin mimics that microphone and is intended to be included in a model for the mBot ranger.
## Steps to use
1. Make a world. This plugin has an [example world](../../worlds/project.world) using the microphone and a tankbot. There is also a [startup script](../../world.sh) for that world.
